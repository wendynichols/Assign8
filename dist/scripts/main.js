"title": "Scotch Whisky Glass, Martin&#39;s VVO, Swizzle Stick Holder, Ceramic Beaker, Vintage Barware",
"description": "This vintage ceramic beaker is adorned with three raised bottles of scotch evenly spaced around. The bottles have detailed labels for Martin&#39;s Original VVO Brand Blended Scotch Whisky. In between the bottles in block lettering are &quot;Light Mellow Friendly&quot;. The rim is painted gold and the beaker has a cork bottom which would have protected it on a damp bar. The bottom also has a paper label with the importer&#39;s information and the beaker was designed by Quality Associates Inc. N.Y.,  N.Y. This was probably a giveaway from distributors to bar owners and liquor store owners. \r\n\r\nMeasures 4 1/4 inches tall, 3 inches across. \r\n\r\nIn good condition with wear to gold rim and cork bottom (please view photos 3 and 4 for detail). \r\n\r\nMore vintage barware at greenandbrown.etsy.com",

"description": "These water bottle labels were inspired by Honey Jack. They are a great addition to a milestone birthday! We will send you a digital file and you simply print and adhere them to your water bottle labels. \r\n\r\nSupplies you need: \r\nPaper\r\nPrinter\r\nRuler and X-acto knife OR scissors\r\nTape\r\n\r\n1. Once you download the file, print out as many labels as you need on paper then trim. Each label is approximately 10.46&quot; wide x 1&quot; high. It&#39;s easiest to use a ruler and X-acto knife and trim along the edges. Trim off excess paper off the ends, if needed. \r\n\r\n2. Simply remove the paper labels from your water bottles and wrap the personalized label around it. Tape into place. Careful not to put these directly into ice as the labels will be ruined. \r\n\r\nNote: this is a digital file only and you will receive a PDF file to print from. Nothing will be mailed to you. \r\n\r\nTo customize, please send us a message. It will take 48 hours to personalize your purchase and email the final file to you. You will need Adobe Acrobat to open and print any file. Note that work cannot begin on personalization until all information is received and item is paid in full. \r\n\r\nAny product names referenced on this shop are trademarked and property of the trademark owner.",

"policy_welcome": "Thank you for visiting my shop. I hope you have found something that catches your eye. All my jewelry is handmade by me, with semi-precious gemstones, with a variety of sterling silver accents and components. \r\n\r\nCare and Maintenance: \r\nSterling silver is the primary metal in most of my pieces.  Sterling will need an occasional polish from wear and natural oxidation.  Polishing cloths can be found in many stores, and I highly recommend them, instead of the &quot;dunk and soak&quot; solutions.\r\n\r\nMeasurements: \r\nMost of my earrings run from about 1.2&quot; to 2.5&quot; in size - I specify the exact size in each listing description - I measure the total length of the earring including the wire - basically the size is &quot;from your ear hole&quot;.  \r\n\r\nNecklaces please select your choice. 18&quot; is the average length, but it&#39;s up to you.   \r\n\r\nShopping With Me:\r\nLike most sellers, I also shop and browse on Etsy, and probably a lot of the other places you do too - so I adopt a &quot;treat as you&#39;d like to be treated&quot; philosophy. I realize there are thousands of other items and sellers, and ultimately want you to feel glad you chose to click on my jewelry. \r\n\r\nLost an Earring?\r\nI provide plastic Clutch stoppers to help you keep them on your ears, but if needed, can often provide a replacement for single lost earrings for half the cost of the original pair plus shipping. This of course depends on my still having the same stones/components, and I can&#39;t promise an EXACT match but I will work with you if needed. Please contact me for a custom listing if you need a replacement and I&#39;ll see what I can do. \r\n\r\n(^.^);",
"policy_payment": "I accept Etsy Direct/Credit Card Checkout, Etsy Gift Cards, or Paypal. All are easy, secure, simple. If you haven&#39;t used either before, Etsy&#39;s check out process will walk you through it. They can link to your credit card (all majors) or bank directly - your choice. \r\nFor items shipped to Florida addresses I am required to collect our state sales tax which goes from me directly to the Dept. Of Revenue. ",
"policy_shipping": "I ship all orders within 1-2 business days after your purchase. I ship via USPS First class, unless otherwise noted or arranged in advance, with actual transit time averaging 3-5 days domestically. \r\n\r\nPlease contact me before confirming your order if you need any special handling so we can be on the same page. Please contact me for a quote for Express or Priority upgrades - prior to purchase if possible, and include your zip code in the message.\r\n\r\nIf I am sending a gift on your behalf to the recipient, please let me know - would you like me to include a short note from you? No problem. \r\n\r\nIf paying by Paypal, your Paypal address should be the one I&#39;m expecting to ship to. I will contact you to discuss if needed, prior to shipping.\r\n\r\nI ship with Delivery Confirmation on all U.S. domestic packages. Orders over $250 will ship require signed deliveries for our mutual protection. International orders now track to Canada, most of the EU, Australia, NZ, and a few other countries.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL Buyers: I will use USPS First class shipping - delivery time varies based on country (2-4 weeks or more). I can upgrade if requested as with domestic, see above.  If your country is not listed as available in the listing, please contact me and perhaps we can make arrangements.\r\n\r\nSpecial Note: Duties and customs that your country requires must be the responsibility of the buyer. Please contact your local customs organization for more information. Please also be aware of your country restrictions specific to jewelry, silver, and gemstones - these laws often change by country. ",
"policy_refunds": "We both want you to be delighted with your purchase. If something isn&#39;t going to work for you, please contact me (convo/email) within 7 days of receipt, so we can mutually agree on either an exchange or return. \r\n\r\nAny refunds we agree to will of course first require a timely, safe return of the unworn items.",
"policy_additional": "Packaging - Your purchases will be individually wrapped in small cardboard jewelry boxes, suitable for gift giving, but performing the double duty of squish-proofing, to ensure their safe arrival, and travel in a protective bubble mailer.

I&#39;m a daytime/US EST person so will try to reply anytime from 9am - 9pm EST (GMT-5) most days, give or take.

Please check this before ordering.\r\n\r\nHOW ARE PRINTS PACKAGED?\r\n8x10 prints - Are packaged in protective cellophane sleeves flat in a 100% recycled rigid mailer. \r\n11x14 prints - Are packaged the same way along with a double thick backing board.\r\n\r\n--- PLEASE KINDLY RECYCLE! ---\r\n\r\nWHERE ARE THEY SHIPPED?\r\nPrints are shipped right to you unless otherwise specified. Please let me know if a print(s) is(are) being sent as a gift! Please be aware that if large prints (11x14s) cannot be left in a mailbox, USPS may leave a slip in its place and you will have to get your order from the post office. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES/DOMESTIC ORDERS - Once shipped you will receive an email notifying you along with tracking information. Usually prints take 2-5 business days to arrive. If things take longer I apologize, once things leave my hands they are out of my control.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL ORDERS - Once shipped you will receive an email notifying you along with customs number. Orders can take anywhere from 1-3 weeks to arrive once shipped. You are responsible for any duties, customs, and taxes levied by your country. Please check with your Customs office and/or Postal Service if you are concerned about possible taxes. \r\n\r\nTRACKING\r\nIncluded on all US orders - you will receive a tracking number when you receive your email confirming your print has been shipped. International orders have delivery confirmation.\r\n\r\nGIFTS\r\nIf your order is a gift for someone please make note of it in the message to seller box at checkout or contact me to let me know. I do not include receipts in ANY packages unless otherwise specified. Please let me know if you would like a gift receipt or a short hand written message included.\r\n\r\nLOST ORDERS\r\nWhile extremely rare, if a package ends up missing along it&#39;s travels to you, I am happy to send a replacement! Because mail can be delayed for a variety of reasons, I will wait 3 weeks from the original ship date of the first package for US orders, and 5 weeks for International orders before sending a replacement. Please let me know if you do not receive your package in that amount of time, otherwise I will assume you received your print(s).\r\n\r\nDAMAGED PRINTS\r\nI ship using rigid mailers to make sure that prints do not bend in transit. All envelops are also marked DO NOT BEND, however sometimes on rare occasions the post office or mail carrier can get a little rough. PLEASE let me know RIGHT AWAY when you get your print if it bent or damaged. I will have no idea otherwise and will assume all is well if I do not hear otherwise :)\r\n\r\nAny other problems please contact me via Etsy convo or email eatsaylove@gmail.com",

"description": "Aged Bourbon :: Kentucky Single Barrel\r\n\r\nThose who have travelled with the Scodioli troupe know that running this outfit is no small task. Madame hustles her bustle from sunrise to sunset, and once those gates close for the night, she&#39;s more than ready to slip into that old clawfoot bath and sip a little whiskey. And this is no coffin varnish, mind you - Madame is terribly particular. Fine old whiskey ranks high on her list of favorites (just below chocolate and shoes, in fact). Although she shares her best bottle with precious few people, she doesn&#39;t see the harm in sharing the bouquet with you, dear reader.\r\n\r\nMadame has based this alluring scent on her favorite single barrel bourbon: delicate floral notes on top of richly aged wood and warm vanilla, earthy spice and the slightest hint of cherry and caramel. Cheers, darlings.\r\n\r\n30 ml\r\n. . . . . . . .\r\nPLEASE NOTE:\r\nThis item is available for ground shipping only (USPS first class), and cannot be shipped outside of the US.\r\n. . . . . . . .\r\nATOMIZER BULB:\r\nShown in last photo. If you prefer this style, simply select the option in the dropdown box, and you will receive both the regular spray top with cap AND an atomizer bulb.\r\n. . . . . . . .\r\nFancy a little gift bag for your spray?

"policy_shipping": "Orders will ship within 2-4 business days of purchase. The Madame ships everything via the US Postal Service. They know her, they love her. They snicker at her beard.\r\n\r\nShipping Overage Refunds for Domestic and International Orders:\r\nIf your shipping price seems way too high, don&#39;t be alarmed. Madame will refund you for any significant overages.",
"policy_refunds": "Generally, all sales are final. There are no refunds or exchanges. If you attempt to return an item that has been used (even slightly), you will not receive a refund.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason you are truly disappointed in your order, don&#39;t hesitate to contact the Madame to discuss your options, and please do so before leaving feedback.\r\n\r\nMadame does not refund shipping fees.",
"policy_additional": "A Note About Solid Perfumes:\r\nThe Madame&#39;s solids will last you a long time. Store at room temperature and remember that the main ingredient is WAX: if left in your car on a hot summer day, be aware that it will melt, so please use caution when opening the tin. (Fragrance will return to it&#39;s solid state once cooled.)\r\n\r\nHow To Use Solid Perfumes:\r\nSimply rub your finger over the surface of the perfume, and then apply to any area of the body, preferably pulse points (your body heat will strengthen the scent). Solid perfumes are for external use only. DO NOT use as lip balm, or on sensitive areas.\r\n\r\nAllergies:\r\nRead all ingredients carefully before ordering, please - especially if you have known allergies to certain fragrances. Please contact the Madame if you have any questions or concerns. She is generally very quick at replying.\r\n\r\nWholesale:\r\nMost items are available for wholesale, and custom orders are welcome. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask! However, we will not do consignment and we will not ship our products to you without labels. It&#39;s the beard or nothing, baby.\r\nIf you are inquiring about a wholesale order, please provide the following info:\r\n– Your shop name and physical location.\r\n– Website if possible, or any social media links to your business.\r\n– Images of your shop (this is very important, as we want to ensure that we will be a good fit in your space).\r\n– A list of the products you are interested in carrying.\r\n\r\nInternational Orders:\r\nPlease note that packages can be delayed in customs for a number of reasons, and on rare occasion you may have to pay an additional fee to claim your package. We apologize that we have no control over this situation. Also please know your country&#39;s guidelines and restrictions for international packages. The most typical reason for packages held in customs is that an item contained within is prohibited by that country.\r\n\r\nFeedback:\r\nWe are perfectionists and we are pleasers. We receive very little negative feedback, and of course we&#39;d like to keep it that way! We understand that you may not like the scent you ordered – everyone&#39;s nose experiences scents differently. Before leaving any harsh feedback, please do consider other aspects of your experience here. We are quite proud of our customer service and speedy shipping. We work hard to deliver a positive experience with every order. xo",

"description": "A beautiful original 1927 Prohibition Prescription for Spirits Frumenti, the US pharmaceutical term for Whiskey...Zxvi (pint)...S. Zii Tid. (2 ounces 3 times daily)! This prescription was the fourth issue; it&#39;s the largest of all five and quite ornate. Please see photos!\r\n\r\nFrom the days of Al Capone, flappers and moonshine this was the only legal way to drink liquor in the US!\r\n\r\nThis prescription has poppies on the top corners, fleur-de-lys on the bottom, and spider-webbed borders!\r\n\r\nThe whiskey was prescribed for Harry Wilson, by Dr. Haughton Smith, on November 18, 1927 and was filled the same day by Pharmacist, Max Harry Siegel, of Siegel&#39;s Drug Store, in Trenton, NJ.\r\n\r\nIt was issued by the Treasury Department and is printed on fancy, beautiful paper, that was also used for U.S. currency. In the center is the old Treasury Seal with the Latin inscription, &quot;Thesaur. Amer. Septent. Sigil.&quot;. When you hold this prescription up to the light, PROHIBITION is watermarked, as with the metal strips that are used in U.S. bills today, the graphics are GREAT!\r\n\r\nThe prescription measures 6 1/2&quot; x 5 3/4&quot;, has light folds, otherwise, condition is excellent..a beautiful prescription...New Jersey poppy scripts are scarce!\r\n\r\nThis is a FANTASTIC piece of history and would be great to display in a pharmacy, doctor&#39;s office, museum, bar or office! I am happy to answer any questions, please feel free to email and thank you for your interest!\r\n\r\nPleased to combine shipping with other Prohibition Prescriptions, Liquor Licenses, Opium Forms & Pharmacy Labels. As always, many thanks to my regular customers for your continued patronage! :)",

"policy_welcome": "Welcome to Calico Juno Designs! \r\n\r\nWith a vast array of selections you can add our unique designs to any outfit for any occasion. Because  all of our pieces are handmade & made to order we can customize a design to your specifications and bring it to you with a promise of outstanding quality, service and value.  \r\nFeaturing over 1,700 designs all of our jewelry has no pre-made or fabricated parts. All gemstones and beads are wrapped individually by hand, and we even make our own hoops, french wires & clasps.  Precious and semi-precious gemstones, Austrian crystals, freshwater pearls, and other stones are used in combination to create a wonderful palette of colors to create original designs.\r\n\r\nAll designs can now be made in solid 14k gold.\r\nEmail us at CalicoJuno@gmail.com for price quotes or any questions you may have.\r\n\r\n**Custom Orders** - Any design can be modified to accomodate your bridal or prom look. Send us any pictures or material swatches to match stones. *NO RETURNS OR EXCHANGES ON CUSTOM ORDERS*\r\n\r\nAll bridal party orders of 5 or more of the same style will receive 15% off! \r\n\r\nJewelry is made to order, so please allow 2-3 days before shipping. \r\n\r\nJewelry is sent securely packaged via USPS first class mail. All US orders come with tracking. Shipping upgrades are available, please inquire.\r\n \r\nWhile we strive to make all the jewelry the same each time, and to look the same as what you see on our site, sometimes due to the nature of the stones and what we have in stock (shading of color, size, shape, faceting, inclusions, etc.), this isn&#39;t always possible.  Please understand that sometimes we may have to substitute a stone or use something slightly different.\r\n\r\nGemstones, Pearls, Stones, and Crystals: \r\n\r\nAll gemstones, pearls, and crystals used by Calico Juno Designs are carefully selected to assure that high-quality stones are used. \r\n \r\nCARE AND CLEANING OF YOUR JEWELRY\r\n\r\n(Turquoise, coral, and other porous stones are not recommended to be placed in cleaning solutions).\r\n\r\nGold - while gold-filled jewelry does not tarnish as does sterling silver, occasionally it can be cleaned/polished (the same way as regular 14k gold) using warm soapy water and an old toothbrush. Or, you can use a commercial liquid gold cleaner.\r\n\r\nSterling silver needs to be cleaned often to keep it bright and shiny, as it will tarnish and become dull and dingy looking, eventually oxidizing and turning almost black (unless you want it to look blackened). You can just dunk your jewelry in the liquid, swish it around for about 5-7 seconds and pull it out...any longer may damage stones!!! Keeping your sterling silver jewelry protected in a jewelry box or commercial jewelry bags infused with anti-tarnishing agents will help slow down the tarnishing. \r\nRinse with warm running water and dry with a paper towel (NOT a cloth or terry cloth towel, as it may snag!), and your jewelry will look bright and shiny again.\r\n\r\nAll Calico Juno Designs jewelry should be handled with care, as it is delicate. If it does snag on something, do not pull at the jewelry as it may stretch it out of shape. Gently hold the jewelry and try loosening the snagged item instead.\r\n\r\nWhile not being worn, the jewelry should be carefully stored in separate quarters away from other jewelry, to keep it from getting tangled. Optimally it should be hung up on special displays designed for hanging jewelry",
"policy_payment": "We currently accept PayPal and it&#39;s a secured way of payment. \r\n\r\n**We are now offering a 30 day layaway plan for all orders under $200.
